# Project: metamorfose-code-generator

## Description
MfCodeGenerator is a tool that generates Java code with ONM (Object-NoSQL Mapper) support. MfCodeGenerator takes as input a NoSQL schema and an ONM config, and generates as result ONM code to access data in NoSQL databases. We use a Direct Acyclic Graph to denote the structure of the entities that are stored into the database. The developers can use the classes in a Java project to write and read data in NoSQL database. Currently, the MfCodeGenerator has support for Spring Data, Impetus Kundera and Data Nucleus. The target NoSQL database is MongoDB. However, it can be extended to support new ONMs and databases.

## Status
MfCodeGenerator is under development. Currently it has support to generate code for three of the most used Java-based ONMs.
